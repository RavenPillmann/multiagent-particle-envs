Policy 7 (maybe):
- Consider adding observations of the tag scenario
- Throwing should have percentage based on distance the quarterback is from the line of scrimmage, but the max possible reward should be higher than running across the first down line.

Policy 6:
- Defense isn't actually coming in contact with qb, so I'm changing the -1 to -distance/10
- Q_back isn't running, but hopefully this will teach them to do so
- See screenshot, changed final rewards
- Widened completion percentage for throw, x position on field of each player by 3 yards either side
- From screenshot, also modified reward for throwing to 800 if completed

Policy 5, switched to these because qback was running away
 (check pic)

Policy 4 was 

 def get_final_reward(self, is_done, agent, made_throw):
        # print(is_done, Q_BACK_NOT_IN_BOUNDS)

        if (is_done == Q_BACK_FIRST_DOWN_LINE):
            if (agent.position == O_LINE) or (agent.position == Q_BACK):
                return 120
            else:
                return -120
        elif (is_done == AGENT_OUT_OF_BOUNDS):
            return -80

            if (agent.position == O_LINE) or (agent.position == Q_BACK):
